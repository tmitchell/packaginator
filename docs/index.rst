   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Packaginator's documentation!
===========================================

Packaginator solves the problem in the Python community of being able to easily identify good apps, frameworks, and packages. Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Python httplib replacement, web framework, or api tool? Packaginator solves that problem for you!

It does this by storing information on packages fetched from public APIs provided by PyPI, Github, BitBucket, Launchpad, and SourceForge, and then provides extremely useful comparison tools for them.
